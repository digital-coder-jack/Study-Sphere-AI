 STUDY SPHERE AI  -  backend/stream_manager.py
=====================================================================
Reliable, race-free streaming control plane.

This module guarantees the core safety invariants of the chat system:

  1.  NEVER allow two active streams for the same session at the same time.
  2.  ALWAYS cancel the previous streaming job before a new one starts.
  3.  Provide a safe, idempotent way to cancel a running stream
      (used both by the explicit /cancel endpoint and by a brand-new
      request that supersedes an in-flight one).

How it works
------------
Each "session key" (here: the chat owner + chat id) maps to a single
``StreamSession`` holding:

  * an ``asyncio.Event`` cancel flag — cooperative cancellation token
  * a monotonically increasing ``generation`` number — every new stream
    bumps it, so a late/zombie generator can detect it has been superseded
  * the ``message_id`` of the placeholder assistant row being written, so
    state updates only ever touch the LATEST assistant message.

A per-session ``asyncio.Lock`` serialises the acquire/cancel handshake so
two requests racing to start at the exact same instant cannot both win.

Because the app may run with multiple workers, the session key is scoped
per-process; for single-worker deployments (the default here) this is a
hard guarantee. For multi-worker deploys, pin sticky sessions or move this
registry to Redis (the interface is intentionally small to allow that).
